          <p>Overall it's been a great week, we had our first customer advisor board meeting on Tuesday. We did
          miss our new customer signup target, mainly with cheese shops, so we are retrenching our target markets a
          bit.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We made a shift toward adding more structure and making roles and commitments explicit,

            <li>We have a company-wide push on customer validation focusing on produce and seafood vendors</li>
